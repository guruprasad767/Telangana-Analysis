            On average, 12 lakhs documents are registered every year. In FY 2019, 16 lakhs documents were registered.
            However, due to the impact of COVID-19, the real estate sector was severely affected, resulting in a drop in
            the number of registrations in FY 2020.
            <br>Stamp duty and other taxes collected from these registrations generate revenue of 73 hundred crores
            every year.

      <ul>
        <li>Rangareddy, Medchal Malkajgiri, and Sangareddy are the top three districts where the majority of document
          registrations occur.</li>
        <li>Regarding revenue generation, Rangareddy, Medchal Malkajgiri, and Hyderabad are the top three leaders.
        </li>
        <li>This is because, even though the document registration count is lower in Hyderabad compared to Sangareddy,
          the revenue generated per registration is higher in Hyderabad, mainly due to its status as a metropolis city
          with higher stamp duty rates.</li>
        <li>Approximately 71% of the revenue is generated solely from these three cities (Rangareddy, Medchal
          Malkajgiri, and Hyderabad).</li>

        <li>We can improve employee skills with practical training programs, making them ready for jobs.</li>
        <li>Investment and development are mostly in Hyderabad and nearby districts. We should also focus on other areas
          by building better roads.</li>
